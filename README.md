Task Given :

1. Take 2 classes from this dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/modelnet10-princeton-3d-object-dataset)

2. Train a conditional GAN that takes a random noise and the class label (the classes you have selected from the dataset) to create new 3D sample of the class

3. You can use any ML library. Make sure you also write comments in your code so itâ€™s easy to follow.
